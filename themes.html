                    is a philosophy that life is meaningless. In the film, Joy
                    is tired of Evelyn's inability to pay attention. Joy
                    reaches her breaking point and becomes Jobu Tupacki. Jobu
                    searches the multiverse for the "right" Evelyn who shares her unhappiness
                    with life and is willing to kill anyone who stands in her
                    way. Joy creates her "Everything Bagel," a tool that sucks
                    everything into oblivion to make all her pain go away.
                    <b
                      >Nearly halfway into the film, Joy/Jobu summarizes this theme by saying, “Nothing
                      matters… If nothing matters, then all the pain and guilt
                      you feel for making nothing of your life, it goes away.
                      Sucked into a bagel” [1:01:02].</b

                    is the belief that even though our existence is pointless,
                    people can still find meaning in life. In the film, Waymond
                    fully embraces absurdism using an unlikely superpower that
                    holds the family together amidst the chaos:
                    <a

                      >kindness</a
                    >. Waymond’s googly eyes are a visual contrast to what the
                    Everything Bagel represents, having a black center
                    surrounded by white.
                    <b
                      >In the beginning, Evelyn rips off his googly eyes and
                      says, “Sometimes I wonder how he would have survived
                      without me.” [0:08:04] Later, Waymond tells her, “When I
                      choose to see the good side of things, I'm not being
                      naive… It is strategic and necessary. It's how I've
                      learned to survive through everything” [1:45:43].</b

                    In the movie, generational trauma was caused by high
                    expectations and a lack of empathy between Gong Gong,
                    Evelyn, and Joy.
                    <b
                      >In a flashback, Gong Gong says to young Evelyn, “If you
                      abandon this family for that silly boy, then we will
                      abandon you. You are not my daughter anymore” [0:14:24].
                      This moment shapes the rest of their relationship.</b
                    >
                    Decades later, Evelyn still tries to please Gong Gong
                    despite his constant statements of disapproval like “Hmph. Another
                    laundromat” [0:12:41] or “Little girl. Always running away.
                    Never finishing what you started” [0:25:56]. Since this is
                    the only example of parenting she knows, Evelyn treats Waymond
                    and Joy with the same emotional distance.
