        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
          This project ran from January through May 2023 
          as part of my thesis for Parsons’ Master in Data Visualization
          program. It was especially meaningful to
          me as a second generation Chinese-American since Everything Everywhere
          All at Once is the only film that has fully understood my experiences.
          To see the film being celebrated around the world while working on 
          this project has been a joy! If you’d like to collaborate together, 
          email me at angelica.hom@gmail.com.<br />

        <h3>DATA AND METHODOLOGY</h3>
        <p>
          The data for this project was manually collected. The first priority
          was transcribing and timestamping every line of the film. The second
          priority was collecting metadata: which character was speaking and to
          whom, duration of the line, language spoken, which universe and
          location the line took place, and a sentiment analysis of each line
          with its own score using VADER Sentiment Analysis. The last priority
          was outlining the 3-act and 15-beat structure of the film, then
          categorizing each line to an act and a beat.
